# -Inverse-and-Forward-kinematics_3DoF_Robot
## **Introduction**
Inverse and forward kinematics are concepts in robotics and computer animation that describe the relationship between the joint angles of a robotic or articulated system and the position and orientation of the end-effector (such as a robotic hand or a character's limb).

Forward kinematics uses the joint parameters to compute the configuration of the chain, and inverse kinematics reverses this calculation to determine the joint parameters that achieve a desired configuration.

Forward kinematics
Forward movement involves determining the final position of the end effector.
